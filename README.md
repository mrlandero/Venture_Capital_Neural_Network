## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

**[Pandas Library](https://pandas.pydata.org/)** - pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,
built on top of the Python programming language.<br>

**[Pathlib Library](https://pathlib.readthedocs.io/en/pep428/)** - This module offers a set of classes featuring all the common operations on paths in an easy, object-oriented way.<br>

**[TensorFlow Library](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow/)** - TensorFlow is an open source software library for high performance numerical computation.<br>

**[TensorFlow Keras Dense](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dense)** - Just your regular densely-connected NN layer.<br>

**[TensorFlow Keras Sequential](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Sequential)** - Sequential groups a linear stack of layers into a tf.keras.Model.<br>

**[SkLearn.model_selection train_test_split](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html)** - Split arrays or matrices into random train and test subsets.<br>

**[SkLearn.preprocessing Standard Scaler](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html)** - Standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.<br>

**[SkLearn.preprocessing OneHotEncoder](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html)** - Encode categorical features as a one-hot numeric array.
